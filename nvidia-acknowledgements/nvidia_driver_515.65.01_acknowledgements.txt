loki_update

    

`nvidia-installer` was inspired by the `loki_update` tool:
<http://icculus.org/loki_setup/>

makeself

    

The self-extracting archive (also known as the `.run` file) is generated using
`makeself.sh`: <http://www.megastep.org/makeself/>

The version of makeself.sh used to create the .run is bundled within the .run
file, and can retrieved by extracting the .run file's contents, e.g.:

    
    
    $ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-515.65.01.run --extract-only
    $ ls -l NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-515.65.01/makeself.sh

Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed under
terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and src/regex/tre*)
is Copyright (C) 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed under a 2-clause BSD
license (license text in the source files). The included version has been
heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity,
and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is

Copyright (C) 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or

Copyright (C) 2003-2011 David Schultz or

Copyright (C) 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or

Copyright (C) 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or

Copyright (C) 2008 Stephen L. Moshier

and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All have been
licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright (C) 2008 The
Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD license. It
was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is Copyright (C)
1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public domain. The
code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions
that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright (C) 2011
Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under the
standard MIT terms.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington
for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for
build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later
supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard
MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced
specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker,
the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above.
Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version
control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments
in each file is in the interest of source tree size.

In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the
copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and
to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include
substantial contributions from:

Bobby Bingham

John Spencer

Nicholas J. Kain

Rich Felker

Richard Pennington

Stefan Kristiansson

Szabolcs Nagy

all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files
covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to
copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions
granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not
having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been
removed.
